# castles-game

This is a game of luck and strategy that can be played in the browser window. It was built and designed with JavaScript and Bootstrap.

The game is currently playable but the ruleset that governs the game is being reworked and improved upon. The opponent AI also needs an overhaul but that will come when the new ruletset is incorporated into the game. The game itself is based on an old card and dice game that I designed a few years ago. It has been heavily modified to make the gameplay more engaging.

GAME RULES (Copied directly from the Guide in the game):

Welcome to the game and thanks for playing. Castles is a small game that you can play right here in the browser window. Let's go over a few things:

The (blue) top row are your opponent's castles. You win the game by destroying all three of them. The (green) bottom row are your castles. If you lose all three castles, you lose the game.

On your turn, you have 2 Action Points (AP) to spend. These can be spent upgrading your castles (Increase Attack, Increase Defense) or attacking your opponent (Attack (x1), <i>Attack (x2)). When you click End Turn, your opponent will move and then your AP will be refreshed.
  
Attack (x1) costs 1 Action Point and rolls a single dice (1-6). Attack (x2) costs 2 Action Points and rolls two dice (2-12). To destroy a castle, you must roll equal to or greater than the castle's defense. For example, if the opponent's castle has a 5 on it, you must roll 5 or higher to destroy it.

Increase Defense increases that castle's defense value. Increase Attack increases that castle's attack value, which only applies when you are attacking the castle that is directly across from that castle.

The maximum defense for castles is 10 and the maximum attack power is +3
